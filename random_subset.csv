211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Excellent game, especially after resolution/framrate fix. Got me scared, not because it's terrifying (it has its moments, though) but because it's friggin' hard. Seriously. It's a game that takes time to learn and rewards patience and perseverance.  Controller fuggin' *required*, though. Don't even bother unless you have that gamepad.",1,0

252690,Fantasy Grounds Classic,"Very good Virtual Table Top.  Pros: - Highly moddable. But you don't have to. - Automation is powerful, but optional! Makes house rules very compatible. - Actually, it's just plain powerful all around. - Does everything you can do on a real tabletop, and then some (fog of war, for example!)  Cons: - Confusing DLC structure. - It needs to be more clear that you don't get anything beyond bare basic DnD rules and a few other generic things, and you have to buy the rest. - Only host can be GM. Even with ultimate... this was nearly the dealbreaker for me, but I do like DM :D - Steep learning curve, but this is to be expected.  Additonal notes: A new edition is coming this year, providing line of sight, dynamic lighting, 3D maps (and maybe tokens). They said they will charge for the upgrade, but they intend it to be only a few dollars for those that bought it recently. Might change of course, but if the new version kicks as much ♥♥♥ as FG in its current state, it will be worth!",1,0

256190,Enemy Front,"Here are, in my opinion, the scores for this game: Gameplay ------ 6/10 Story------------ 5/10 Graphics -------- 8/10 Sound/Music----- 7/10 Overall ----------- 6,5  Conclusion: Enemy Front is an FPS set in WW2 period with very nice graphics but poor storyline, physics and AI. Has easy achievements to unlock meanwhile multiplayer is almost inexistent and very slow-paced, so try to avoid it. In overall it's surprisingly good, better than I expected from an indie game.",1,0

376570,WildStar,"I downloaded this game just to mentioned this but ever since this game has been put on steam, I can't log into it from its original launcher at all and i even tried this steam version too, nothing.   I needed to verify my IP cause I played this game different IP before so you get the code from your mail of your account and enter on the site and confirm, done this before many times its worked fine,but since this game has been on steam.....whatever code you get doesn't work period. I've even copied and pasted in into the code verification and it -still- didn't work. When I doesn't accept a copy and paste then you really know is wrong with NCsoft's site itself. I submited a ticket for this issue and the link took to google search for some  reason....wth?   Honestly it seems best to just make a new account from scratch and never ever change IPs ever again as its clearly working for others playing this game on steam and even using their account before hand.   I still recommend the game itself as its great but damn NCsoft site for this bullsh*t locking my account out.",1,1
371660,Far Cry Primal,"This game is amazing. Enough said, but I will say more. I like this game because it puts a new twist on the game mechanics. Instead of guns there are mele weapons and bows. All of which are throwable except bows but they are ranged allredy. There are people who say this game is a new skin of Far Cry 4 and, it is. But there is much more fun to be had in this land of warring tribes. I personaly like the caves they are a neat puzzel. Well that is all I will say.

The tactics are quite complicated to understand at first.  All in all though, this is a fantastic game imo, apart from those few negatives. I would probably give it around a 7.5/10",1,0

Never ever have I had a book, movie or game touch me so much. The story, the artwork, the music and the overall ambience make me never forget this game ever.

242920,Banished,"I have bought this game on release because im interested in this genre. This is not a casual game and requires great patience and skill. Lets got through pros and contras.  + Offers random map generation (seed, size, type, difficutly etc.) + Challenging (hard to master, i failed about 15 attempts before my city could get stable and healthy/happy) + Deep simulation system (unlike other city builders, peoples age/gender plays a great role, family is a core unit,  people dont spawn randomly, they can only be born as kids and then age into students/workers, later on you can invite  nomads into your village) + Original gameplay (different from anno/simcity, requires micro'ing, resource system)  - Contains lots of bugs (savegame crash, some buildings texture bugs, trading doc bug etc.) - Doesnt support DX11 properly (switching to DX9 will avoid lots of crashes)  I think this game will provide simulation fans with many-many hours of fun. Although the crashes are annoying and ruine this fun. I recommend to pay attention to forums before u give out 18 Euro. Once most of the major bugs (savegame/trading ship) are fixed, this game will turn into a candy!",1,0

It is very noticeable when you are playing it second-third time (feel yourself a prophet), some one full-random adventure(mega-dungeon or smth) would be nice.  *Soloing It is a hell of a job, only 2-3 classes can do it (yes, yes this is not solo game, right).",1,0

The story is intriguing and has a strangeish mix of real-life and supernatural entwined, with a twist at the end that didn't hit me as hard as it perhaps should have but may impress others more so.  The puzzles overall are mostly logical and have a unique mechanic by allowing you to rotate around objects to find clues, information or switches which adds a nice element the 2d counterparts don't or aren't able to showcase.  There are however 2 to 3 dodgy puzzles. I had to go on the internet twice, once for some dialogue refresh to remember what I was trying to do next and then for the symbol puzzle towards the end which I don't think was done as well as the others in terms of figuring it out for yourself.

If the devs really wanted to they could have left the game forever in early access after they made a boatload of money out of it. However they didn't do that and instead kept updating and polishing it bringing it to where it is today. Hate the devs or not that was nice on their part, something that I can't say holds true when compared to a lot of other early access games on Steam. That being said, this game is a lot of fun if you are a fan of exploring. The only real problem I had with this game is unlike Terraria where I could make a home base and build it up, there really doesn't feel like any reason to do that in Starbound. Instead I went from planet to planet as a scavenger. I'm pretty sure this is how most people play this game and this isn't bad but after a while it can get boring. There are a plethora of different biomes and dungeons within them but after a while it DOES start to get repetitive and that's the main thing I have against this game. However that doesn't make it a bad game, and it's still definitely worth your time. I'll give it an 8/10",1,0

365450,Hacknet,"Note: This review was made directly after finishing a first playthrough of Hacknet and lacks information on replayability or side missions, as I believe I missed one while playing.  If you want an entry into the hacking style of game in which you need to infiltrate systems without being traced to your location complete with great music and an intense atmosphere, buy this game now. If you're not interested, get your priorities checked. You're missing out on a genre that has become loved by so many people due to the easy to learn but hard to master type of gameplay.  Pros: - Great music - Great visual effects - Runs at 60FPS almost consistently if your computer doesn't suck like mine - Amazing introduction to a genre that I was sort of lost in beforehand. - Difficulty spikes are usually your fault because you forgot the command 'porthack' somehow. (POINT AND LAUGH AT THE EXPECTED)  Cons: - If your computer does suck like mine, you'll have to turn down the resolution a bit and turn off scanlines and the great visuals at later parts in the game. - I got a bit lost, but it's likely my fault, so you should be fine. (CONTINUE TO POINT AND LAUGH AT THE EXPECTED)   Overall, I loved the game. I finished it in about 6 hours and left the game on as I ate dinner, which shows the 6.5 hours at the time of this review. Why did I mention that? Because sometimes a look behind the scenes can make you realize why Curators have their jobs instead of people like myself.",1,0

274940,Depth,"I've been playing this game since early Alpha and even talked to one of the developers for a while to help work out some bugs. This has got to be my all time favorite Indie game. The developers seriously do care about their game and continue making improvements to it. There has never been an instance where I felt like they didn't care about their product or player base. The game is immensely fun yet overlooked a lot. I could be biased on the atmosphere since I'm a Marine Biologist, but that in no way shapes my feelings towards how good of a game this is.  4 people play as divers to get their DPV to the very end, and 2 players will play as sharks to stop them. Each team has a collected 30 lives and once those are up then you lose. Sharks will also lose if they do not exhaust the divers' lives before they reach the end. There's quite a few sharks you can choose from, and divers get a plethora of weapons to use, so each match will be different from the next. It's much better than a lot of AAA games that have come out in these recent years.",1,0

Eventually, I went on the forums and it turns out this is happening to a LOT of people. This needs to be fixed along with many other bugs. None of my trails will save at the moment.  This really is a great game, with amazing graphics, good gameplay and challenges, and just overall great aspects such as go pro views on replays, mountain stories, etc. But at the moment it is definitely not worth $60 or even close to that, because the game will most likely crash after 5 to 10 minutes. If these crashes are fixed and some of the other major bugs are too, then I will change this review.

I kinda shrugged it off think that it wasn't such a big deal. But then they released their first DLC (Black Ice) also known as Patch 1.2. It was then were they put me all the back into the bronze division. No matter what I do I can't get out of it either. I'd win a bunch games and not get promoted, but I lose one and I then get demoted. This is no way have a ranking system and it makes the game rather frustrating. As of now I can not say that I like this game because of this. I am a fairly decent player at this game and there should be absolutely no reason I'd get demoted into bronze.",-1,0

9900,Star Trek Online,When I first saw this game I was like ok lets give it a go. Well after giving it a go I have to say they have and still are doing a great job. There tons to do even if you reach the max level you still get points to spend on your character which is cool. The daily events also help getting rare and important equipment. There are alot of fan made missions as well just in case you want to take a break from the main missions and if you are stuck then other players if you ask will be there to help but the mission will get tougher with the more players in the mission. Also if you like clans then there are more then a few to join. My dislike is that when playing as UFP that sometimes you have to do some past missions you already done just to level up to the level that it wants you to be to carry on in the game which was a let down. But other then that its the best Star trek Game yet and it gets better with friends.,1,0

However, it is quite straight-forward game, you are basically only able to go through specified 'corridors'. There are some 'dead ends' containing scrolls/collectibles. For me, it took cca 7 hours to play singleplayer part from start to end on normal difficulty. Multiplayer looks very interesting and is based on coop play including few modes (I havent tried out all of them). One flaw I cannot forgive this is that it is so clear that this game was created for Consoles and controllers. Overall, I think the game is worth 40% its price if it comes just to campaign. If you count in also MP, I would go for 70% (currently). I enjoyed every single part of it and will try to find someone for MP.",1,0

The character design and class diversity is nice, along with their abilities, but I think they don't stand out from each other enough when playing.

All items can be unlocked, nothing needs to be purchased and everything is reasonably balanced. The gameplay is smooth, fun and balanced.

If you like puzzle platformers, do your gamer brain a favour and check this game out. It's $5, and I spent 9 hours thoroughly enjoying it. Well worth the money.",1,0

55230,Saints Row: The Third,"Have you ever wanted to be a gangster turned celebrity turned gangster? Because this is the game for you! Featuring an expansive open world full of various gangs, poverty, and police that paints a great picture of a crime-filled metropolis on the decline. The car customization is great, the character creater is nice and over the top. Its an open world game you can easily get lost in. Even in 2016 the game is still beautiful if you don't look at the small details like shop windows and samey npcs. The humor in it is great, although quite crude. I also think that this is the greatest Saints Row game, and 4 is nowhere near as good as this game. It is my city-crime-sandbox of choice.",1,0

I dont even care that to story seems to have been written by a high man (wont spoil it for obvious reason) becasue the game play is just so fun especially with the upgrades that again call back to bullet hell games. The endless and time attack modes add some extra replay value will endless mode Just gets more and more ridiculous to the point where the screen is just fill with robots throwing themselves at you and drills renacting gurren lagann's climax. Not to mention the music that really gets you pumped for the fight and since earning new songs is entwined with gaining new power ups the games sound track never gets stale.   Now if you have slower reflexes you wont like this game as it will get fustating for you and if you arnt into EDM/dubsteppy music than you may not like the sound track but im not a huge fan of those genres yet I find myself really getting into it",1,0

I'm almost 30 hours in and I couldn't be more hooked. ofcourse it has it's flaws. -some animations can be a bit stiff, as can be expected from a game from it's day. -NPC's are all pretty much the same, except for some big story characters.  Now for the things that make it great. -The combat system, though not a popular opinion, adds a great deal to the game. instead of button/key smashing your way through, you need to think about what type of style you could use best and with what weapon and it makes timing more essential than waving your big ♥♥♥ sword around, which makes the swordfighting way more realistic and intense IMO. -The story is a great piece of writing, just go see for yourself! -Quests are very diverse and choice and concequense always play a big part. -Many, many more things!! -Geralt is a badass!",1,0

Playing with friends? Forget it. 99/100 times the game says I stopped hosting even though I hit start game. Yes me and my friend have closed down and restarted the the issue still persisted. At one point I wasn't able to click with my mouse or PS4 touchpad (could have been the DSR I was trying).   The gameplay itselt feels pretty off. It could be fun if the characters moved more like characters in Smash rather than Little Tikes My First Video GameTIM. Maybe try making a few more characters, for the same price I can get fighting games with triple the roster and more that also have better gameplay, more stages and don't crash everytime you start an online match.   Maybe buy this if you want to waste $14, or save that money and get a copy of Brawl for your WIi that's just lying around and play a real party fighting game and not this early access tier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",-1,1

291150,,"Free and open source. Evolution RTS does everything right. It runs very smoothly, has very nice music that as far as I can tell from other reviews is somehow being dynamically generated. The units look a little bit samey from a distance, just different looking SCV-ish looking robots. Upon zooming in however you do realize that they are indeed varied and have varied robotic exoskeletons. The graphics are effective although it could still compel more more immersion by adding more scenery elements and whatnot. There really is no reason for you not to have this into your library. It is a fine addition... except for one thing...  It somehow manages to feel extremely generic still, I do not know who I am controlling, why I am fighting, I do not know what the unit does, how the tech tree is meant to work, and a lot of numbers are on screen I am not sure which are metal and which are energy, or why I am making those thingies in the ground. It was more or less painless for me to use the lobby to make a single player game but after scouting around with a random robot army sustained by my low supply count and not finding the AI... I simply was too disengaged to really invest more time in it.   This game would strongly benefit from single player scenarios that give context, introduce the player the game's concepts, and give some reason to idenfify, care, and have fun. A lot of the fun from strategy games is the sense of control you end up having from implementing strategies and seeing their outcome and I am sure that with a basic storyline, with gradual introduction of units it would be a lot more immersive. And maybe make the rest of the lobby and the multiplayer components separate from it. A simple artwork menu with Tutorial, Single player, Multiplayer buttons goes a long way.  In any case I do think this is at least a 6 out of 10. It looks average, but it could become much much much more. And since it is free and open source it should be treated as greater than average. I'll come back to the game in the future and see how it came along. In the meantime I will catch up on playing some of those other RTS's I own that have all I mentionned and that I never got to play or finish.",1,0

391540,Undertale,"Many people think this game is just another earthbound ripoff with cheap characters. Tell me, how many have actually played the game?  I hear you asking:'What makes this game so great?' Well...first off: The soundtrack This game's soundtrack is easely one of the best i have heard in quiet a while. Despite being a retro-styled game, the music isn't just retro beeps, but it contains actual instruments as well. Notable music tracks are 'Spider dance' and 'Megalovania'.  Second: The characters The characters in Undertale are simply loveable, and there's a good reason why. Let me explain some of the main characters for you. There's Flowey, who, despite looking very innocent, might as well be the devil himself, because he doesn't have feelings like love, depression, etc, which is explained as you play. There's Sans, who is a laid-back skeleton that loves to joke around, and older brother of Papyrus, who tries very hard to capture a human in order to join the royal guard.  And then there's the game mechanics First of all, you should know that this game has several types of runs. There's the Pacifist run, where you kill nobody. Not even the bosses. There's the neutral run, where you kill some monsters, but not all of them. And there's the Genocide run, where you murder EVERYTHING! I don't recommend the Genocide run for the newer players, because not only is this game mode significantly harder, you will also affect the pacifist run permanently. Why would it affect the pacifist run? Well...lets just say that, even after you reset your game, the characters remember everything you've done. Every action, every kill, every choice you made, EVERYTHING. The only way to delete their memory is by doing a true reset.  Last, but not least: The story The story, depending on what run you're doing, is AMAZING! I'm not gonna spoil it for you, because you have to experience it for yourself. But...one important aspect of the story is that the characters seem to know that they're in a game. Flowey, for example, know that you have the power to 'SAVE' (which he also has). Sans is aware that even if they escape the undeground, the player (you) will just reset the game, leaving them without memory of them escaping in the first place (we're talking about the true reset), which is why he is so careless about everything (or it could just be an excuse to be lazy).  Do i recommend this game? Absolutely! Do i recommend you buying the soundtrack? Hell yeah! Is it worth the 10 bucks? It's worth double the value.",1,0

Sadly, in terms of gameplay it feels weaker than the original. The large dinosaurs are more like sitting ducks, and the raptor pounce is much more clunky to use. The humans' move speed is frankly much too high, in the original, being caught alone as a human meant certain doom, but now any human can 1v1 a trex if they just strafe in circles.  Even after a year of early access, the game still has crippling bugs. More than once I have been spawned under the map. Large dinosaurs frequrently get completely stuck on objects, and Ive even had a few hard crashes.  Hopefully these issues can be ironed out in the coming weeks, but at the time of writing this review, I cannot recommend this to anyone who isnt a major dinosaur lover.",-1,1

345820,Shantae and the Pirate's Curse,"Shantae, the half-genie heroine of Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, is more than just an upstart in the Metroidvania genre – she's the new star. At a glance, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse may look like a game for kids, but it's actually very deep and expertly designed, appealing on a variety of levels from platforming and exploration, to music and visual style. I love the sense of humor, too – there are tons of outrageous gags that make both the good guys and the bad guys completely lovable.   More so than its predecessor, Risky's Revenge, Pirate's Curse feels like a platformer, with more clearly-defined levels (islands that you sail to) and difficult platforming segments that require multiple attempts to complete. There's a general lack of warp points within the levels, which can make for a bit of frustration when you realize that you have to go through an entire area again to pick up something you missed. Also, the whole game feels a bit too small, and I wish there were more support items to use (like the pike balls) to add more depth to the gameplay.  Problems aside, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is the most fun I've had with this genre since the classic 2D Castlevania games. It's funny, stylish, and all-around an outstanding game that I heartily recommend.   (Rating: 8.5/10 “Excellent”)  Notes: I played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. I recommend using a console controller like this for all platformer-type games, since it allows for greater precision control.",1,1

But I do like this game and I think the levels have a unique charm to them and so do the animations I also think the game is well made and the music is very nice and fits well also there's also alot of detail from what I've played so far....  However the voice acting is pretty poor and can sound very awkward I know these guys are supposed to be comedians but it sounds like the games trying to hard at certain points to be funny and at others the voices sound awful as even in the intro of the game you can hear pewdiepie voice acting both himself and the villian. Also certain points in the begining levels Pewdiepie and Marzia sound awkward.   Anyhow Mark is the best voice actor I've heard so far and sounds on point evn if his lines are random as can be... anyway from what I've played I would say this game is 7/10 the story isn't the best and it's heavily influenced by pewdiepies channel content and to people wo are unfamiliar with it, it just seems really random *cough* exploding whales falling from the sky *cough*.

391540,Undertale,"Personal Tip : Use your own Name when you choose a name for your character. I think you will find it a worthwhile decision. I personally found the game even more rewarding, because the characters I met used my name. This decision especially bore meaningful fruit during the end game.   Undertale is one of those rare, shooting stars of an experience that, if you stick with it, and are well disposed to its genre, unique personality, and cultural sensibilities, will have an experience that will leave a permanent change chiseled onto your heart.   I haven't reached the ending yet, but the path I took in the game has led to such a powerful positive deonuement , so moving, so honest, so touching of the deep feelings I believe are fundamental to everyone, that I found myself openly crying with gratitude.   Toby Fox is abundantly aware that his core themes are constantly explored in Anime; he isn't shy about making regular references to the great story telling medium that is Anime and the motifs consistently explored in the most popular of them.  Themes like : 1. Staying true to your beliefs 2. Never giving up, no matter how bleak things look  3. The power of friendship (which almost always manifests itself as a physical power to save one's friends) 4. Accepting people for who they are, no matter how weird they see themselves as being, no matter if they think they're losers 5. An often off the wall, truly wacky sense of humor (which the game has in spades, hoes, and shovels!)  6. When you believe in yourself, and have earned the belief of others, you can save the world  7. When others need you, you tap into a power that you never knew you had  Some people might see the game as 'derivative' and 'unoriginal' since, again, its themes are readily found in most popular Anime, but I would say that the game is done with so much love and belief in the themes of Anime, that those themes are given a new and unique life in the world of Undertale. The game is not simply imitating these timeless themes, it is weaving them into a special shape that touches people in another way...a good way...a lasting way.   Need I say it, but Toby Fox is the quintessential model of the Renaissance Man. At 23, he has accomplished something revolutionary in the gaming genre.  1. Programming : The game is bug free as far as I can tell during my 15 hours. Admittedly, the game does not have the complexity of a Triple A title, but for 1 guy to create a game with the many moving parts Undertale has, and for the game to run so smoothly is a feat, so I think.  2. Combat / Dynamic Evasion System : The 'Combat' mechanic in the game is wholly unique in my experience with RPG's. Combining 'Bullet-Hell' gameplay with 'Turn-Based' combat was a stroke of genius! It really works! And the Bullet-Hell scenarios are unique and surprising for each 'enemy' you encounter. I would even venture to say that the way each 'enemy' attacks you is a Story-Telling device unto itself, actually, I think I will say that they are absolutely part of the Story-Telling mechanics of the game. Fighters will tell you that one learns a great deal about a person through engaging them in combat. Toby Fox has created a 'combat'...y'know... let's call it an 'engagement' system that is Fun! and adds to the Story-Telling a great, great deal.   Now, taken individually, all these elements could be considered laudatory, but hardly revolutionary; however, when all these elements are combined into one game, by one person!...well, that is a revelation!  But, it is the path of non-violence and choosing instead to understand others, which makes this game truly revolutionary.   The music in the game is just stellar. I purchased the soundtrack. If you liked the game, you will definitely like the soundtrack. ;)  When I listen to 'Hopes and Dreams' and 'SAVE The World!' I feel a tremendous desire to do all those things : be filled with Hope! fulfill my Dreams and help fulfill the Dreams of others! and ultimately save the World!  I can feel that moment those songs play in the game and the faith of the friends you have made in the game flowing through yourself. It's moving stuff. It's eternal stuff.   And the main theme of the game, the referentially titled 'Undertale' is such a beautiful song. So whimsical, and just lovely. A story about a young boy or girl who falls into a hole and enters another world where they experience a powerful adventure, and are given the choice to choose how they will meet life : as an aggressor or embracer... A thoughtful piece of music. It stays with you.   - Note : I will keep working on this review when I have some more free time. If you've read until now : thanks a lot! It really is a special, special game. : ) -   ---- Original Review ----  Do I recommend this game....? Hmm... Let me think... Only a million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion...obbedy-gillion times! I'm not even done the game yet and I'm nearly 15 hours in! This game...this game...it's a watershed moment in gaming, in popular culture...even...dare I be so portentous...human evolution.   I don't have the words to describe my thoughts on this game to the width and breadth I would be satisfied with at the moment, but, suffice it to say...I think that whatever happens in the rest of my life...I will always be able to find a little space inside myself that is : Filled With ' DETERMINATION !

438920,Legends of Callasia,"Hidden gems, that's why I love the gaming industry so much. From the day I have discovered Gothic, I was looking for the next game that will take me by suprise and keep me playing for hours.  I have always enjoyed sort of table top/board game/risk like games. We have had some in the past like 2-3 risk games, Slay by Sean O'Connor or Desktop Dungeons. I was wondering what will be the next one to capture my attention and here it is: Legends of Callasia.  This game is an excellent example that there is still room for improvement within an existing genre. It has it's own unique style and what it aims to achieve it does superbly so.  I have recently finished Rise of Tomb Raider and have been frustrated by the game's artificially inflated systems that were design to create an impression there is variation and different options. Instead RoTR has created a boring environment where I was just getting frustrated that devs have introduced 2-3 things that are basically the same and are not only pointless but also annoying, like the arrow head climbing.   In Legends of Callasia every card, every unit or building serves a specific function and has it's use. I also enjoy the visuals, they are crips, bright colours allowing you to quickly read the situation on the map. Little touches like clouds or dragons flying over the map show the attention to detail. I also greatly enjoy the short briefings before each campaign mission which give you useful info on where from to expect an attack.   Games even has room for some plot twists. That along side with custom objective in the campaign really creates nice challage. Another thing worth mentioning is the replayability value and it is pretty great in this game. I have played one map multiple time and each time I ended up executing different strategies.  Game always you to skip battles if you do not wish to watch them.  The only two things I would list as negatives (not ruining the experience but fixing of those would make the game near perfect): - if there was some well design system to actually play battles manually that would add another layer of depth, but this would have to be well designed really or otherwise it would spoil a great game - I wish there was a way to complete skip watching the time between turns and make it go faster, but I know that many turn based games suffer from it (total war series for example).  TL:DR version: Great game, offering good level of chalange, engaging, with both single and multiplayer, worth it's full price.",1,0

405970,Flat Kingdom Paper's Cut Edition,"Flat Kingdom is the Steam debut of talented Mexican developers Fat Panda Games. The team hail from the region of Yucatán which includes the city of Merida. Their mission is to deliver games that are fun and feature balanced gameplay and great graphics. They are inspired by great games of the past but have a desire to put unique personality into their games. Prior to being known as Fat Panda Games the team created mobile games under the banner of Ghost Apocalypse teaming with RCK Games and Lobo with Shotguns. The team intends to port Flat Kingdom to PlayStation 4.  The first thing that I gained a deep sense of prior to the game beginning was that the game was developed around a level of lore not usually seen in many platforming games. It is clear that the story and the world really meant a lot to the developers as they were building their game. It appears that every decision is based upon this lore and as a consequence one of the game’s greatest strengths is its cohesion.  One of the aspects of the game that I have enjoyed most to date is the papercraft art. Thanks to games such as Tearaway this art style has become increasingly popular in games and great artists have been able to create beautifully vivid games with the technology available to them. It’s a lot of work but when it pays off it does so in a dramatic fashion. The game is colorful and bright and is a real joy to watch as you play throughout the game. Another aspect of the presentation that I thoroughly appreciated was the soundtrack of the game. I’m a big fan of Manami Matsumae who created the soundtrack to games such as Mega Man and Shovel Knight.  One of the things that I wasn’t such a huge fan of – and that’s purely because of my own viewpoint – was that the game was a little more challenging in parts than what I would have liked. For example, some of the double jumps require absolute precision as it is super easy to fall just short of the mark. You wont necessarily die as a consequence but you can get stuck in places for an inordinate amount of time. I’d argue that the controls aren’t quite as tight as what they could be but that may just be subjective. In regards to the controls this is another game that is at the mercy of the Xbox One controller and Unity engine conflict with the game forcing me to roll back my drivers to a much earlier version in order to play. I wish that this was an issue that would be repaired by the Unity developers because it is a source of constant aggravation with their engine.  A review of the game would be remiss if I failed to mention just how much gameplay there is in the game and how many hidden pathways there are that often lead to lucrative awards in the shape of coins that enable the player to purchase things such as additional hearts (life) from the storekeeper that you can find before each level.  A very reasonable platformer and a game that I am quite happy to recommend. The game has a ten percent discount until April 23rd on the Steam store.",1,1

But whether or not the game makes you think, it does provide a great time learning to quickly massacre rooms full of thugs out to kill you. It's quick twitch, it's retro, it's gory, and it's simple in some of the best ways. It has a killer sountrack of pumping techy beats that are both gloomy and adrenaline-firing. This is a bit of a masterclass in game design in terms of having every element contribute something to the overall sense and experience that the game aims to provide. Whether it really shoots at deeper issues will be up to you to decide, but at least you'll have a blust busting jaws. 9/10.",1,0

411630,Wicked Witches,"What can be said about Wicked Witches? put simply, alot...  Wicked witches has a great concept for playing the bad guy(GIRL). It has flavour, aesthetic and enjoyable game play mechanics with childrens fairy tales from a sinister perspective.  However, it feels very unpolished for being released, there is a lot of UI bugs, multiple grammatical errors in scripting (Grammer nazis be warned) and the narrative plot seems very.... bare. Quite simply, it has a quick and understandable backstory, but a lot of the plot feels more like 'I don't like this, destroy that', but this game is about vengeance aganinst the world so why not destroy everything.  To Praise:  - well thought out environment features, destructible buildings and morphable environments  - fun character &amp; weapon design  - every little detail the game devs worked on  Things of note:  - again, UI errors, some grammer issues in script...  - some effects like the building destruction fire can cause serious lag when enmasse, AKA The Witch of Bellechasse level with three towns, lots of destroyed buildings fires = lots of CPU used creating lag  - unit damage ratios and health, it's usually easy to die, implementing a difficulty setting that affects health and damage ratios wouldn't hurt the game for different player types.  Overall, this game gets a praise from me as it was just plain silly fun and I had a blast playing through destroying the peasant rabble. Definantly worth a play for gamers that like the reverse role and want to see the world BURN!!!  See how we did here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5IMBmwI3bM ",1,0

245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"Yes, I am reviewing it after barely any playtime, but I do have a good reason for it.  Skullgirls is a fighting game developed by Lab Zero, directed by some of the biggest genre enthusiasts like Mike Z, with a unique art style, original characters with interesting fighting styles and jam-packed with references to other video games, anime, TV shows and whatnot.  Let's start with the graphics, or rather, the art style. It has that cartoonish, rough feel to it - most of the story art looks a little sketchy, but the in-game sprites themselves are amazingly detailed, and even the stage lighting visibly affects them. Also, the female characters are rather... fanservicey at times, which actually does kind of complement how everyone is drawn.  The sound effects for hitting enemies are immensely satisfying, and the music is some of the best I've heard in fighting games (though it's not nearly as diverse as for example what games like BlazBlue or Guilty Gear have to offer). It's overall very good in that department.  Each character is unique and has his or her own mechanics and fighting style, often very unorthodox with what we've seen in other fighting games. On one hand this makes them feel fresh, on the other this makes learning them a tad bit harder.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the Story Mode. While DLC characters indeed get much more fleshed-out storylines, the ones that belong to the vanilla characters are very lackluster and short in comparison. You don't really get too much narrative about who they are or what they're doing - and it's a shame, considering the setting of the game is just begging to be explored.  Also, I can't forget about the biggest issue: the PC port of 2nd Encore got skewed rather badly, as it's missing two modes in comparison to the console versions - Challenge Mode and most worryingly Trial Mode.  Trial Mode is, putting it simply, a 'perform shown combo' mode that teaches you how to combo as a specific character. Considering this is a rather complex fighting game, being able to effectively perform combos is a must if you wanna play on any considerable level, at least in online matches. It eases you into a character and puts some groundwork for you to get better, familiarize with how general comboing works, and then proceed to try and use your intuition and knowledge to learn the character more deeply and finally master it. And since the PC version lacks it, you don't actually get that kickstarter. All you get is a short tutorial on how each single special and super of a character works and that's it, you're off to figure out everything on your own, when you have barely any knowledge about the character, don't know what can cancel into what, making it frustratingly difficult to actually start out.  Now a mode like this wasn't included in older fighting games, but we're not 'older' here. BlazBlue, Street Fighter, Guilty Gear - all the newest iterations of those fighting game franchises do include a mode like this, that actually teaches you combos. Meanwhile, Skullgirls lacks it, which is what kills the game for me - I am forced to either spend hours upon hours figuring out how to combo myself with no prior knowledge about the character, or just give up. I know you can just look up some combos online, but it isn't the same or nearly as convenient as an in-game mode that does the same, with more readable inputs that actually show up on the screen, as well as a possible demonstration on how it actually should look like by the A.I.  I am not going to speak about the balance in this game as I don't think I played it for a long enough time to actually judge it to any extent.  I really don't want to give this game a negative review, but I can't enjoy a game that refuses to teach me how to play it. Especially that it's a clearly inferior port in comparison to the console versions. Taking into account those factors, my verdict couldn't possibly be positive. On the other hand, it can be just as easily changed IF they add the missing modes to the PC version.  @EDIT: Gonna clarify that 2nd Encore now does possess the combo-teaching mode... but it's locked behind a paywall. Definitely even more of a reason not to come back.",-1,1

I know most of the Reviews here are regarding the price upgrade and how its not worth it because of how little the changes are, but there have been a few so far that are very noticable. Coming form some a person who has played both versions of the game I have to say I like this one better.   In my opion it has been imporved in a few ways. first it seems to me like the game mechanics are a lot smoother now and the new enemy placement is okay. For a verteran player its nothing that will really catch you off guard. There has been changes to the areas as well, such as new item placement and new features (a new path can be opened that wasnt in the original version). As far as the graphics are concered I haven't really noticed much of a difference. There are some places that I have been where the lighting is greatly improved.   Overall if your new to the series and want to play it I would reccomend it. If your a verteran and want a new experience look at the upgrade like buying a dlc for the game.",1,0

233450,Prison Architect,"Awesome little game and the shining light for any aspiring EA developer. The game does exactly what you expect, you can build a prison and then manage it.  The campaign functions well as a good tutorial to the game.   I wish there were more grant objectives in the main game, but there are enough to keep you interested for a long time.  There are a few bugs that crop up every now and again, but I've found that they usually right themselves if you save and reload the map. This happens to me maybe once every 30-40 hrs and only on my largest prisons.   Also, if you want multiples of some buildings in your prison, the AI can do some stupid things (like have 20 cooks at one kitchen, instead of 10 working in each of the two kitchens. I would like the ability to assign staff to certain work areas (the same way you can assign prisoners to certain work areas). But these really are minor gripes.  If you like management sims or even city builders, you will probably get a lot of enjoyable gaming hours from Prison Architect.  8/10.",1,0

234190,Receiver,"Receiver, a game made in under seventy-two hours by Overgrowth developers, Wolfire Games, is a procedurally generated first person shooter with hyper detailed gun mechanics; even actions as seemingly simple as reloading require a great deal of familiarity with how the weapon works. Your opposition consists of stationary turrets and flying taser-bots, all of which can and will kill you very quickly.  Being made under such time contraints, the game can appear a little undercooked, but once the admittedly steep learning curve is overcome, the result is an intense, immersive, challenging experience that is difficult to walk away from. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a nice change of pace from your typical FPS fare.",1,0

287290,Resident Evil Revelations 2,"With the addition of online multiplayer you'd think it would be better, but no, it's not. Multiplayer is completely broken and matchmaking can never find anyone to play with. The fact that multiplayer was added after everyone hit lvl 100 with all their characters is just ridiculous anyway. The story starts out strong then just gives you all the answers in episode 3, they could have even put SPOUILER AHEAD warnings. Raid mode was amazing, until I hit lvl 100 and unlocked Code Red or Very Very Hard difficulty which is way too hard to complete on your own and due to the broken multiplayer is just impossible to enjoy.  Then there's the online events, weekly events that you attempt in raid mode. Beat this mission on the lowest possible lvl and you'll get a reward based on your ranking with the rest of the community. Thanks to cheaters gaining any kind of reward from these events is impossible.  All in all, a decent game that has been completely screwed up by horrible decisions, even worse match making and a story that starts strong then jumps off a cliff. I just cannot recommend this, even though before I would have easily given it 7-8 out of 10.",-1,0

19830,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Gold Edition,"Rainbow Six 3, like most of Tom Clancy's titles, is a squad-based tactical shooter with a lot of depth. This game favors tactics over action, and you will spend hours planning out each mission before actually playing it. Before a mission, you can choose who goes on what team (Alpha, Charlie, etc.), choose their loadouts (a lot of weapons to choose from, each with their own advantages and disadvantages), and plan out the mission waypoint by waypoint. Once you are comfortable with how the planning stage works, you can coordinate attacks from multiple angles, give go-codes to execute orders, set the rules of engagement, and so on. The game gives you the option to either play through the mission or watch the AI do what you have told them to do. It's a really nice option, because it's basically two totally different styles of gameplay. You can play it as a strategy game, being the man calling the shots, or play it through the eyes of a Rainbow operative. Pick this one up.",1,0
22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"One of my favorite games, only topped by the original Fallout. Has great RPG elements, fantastic setting, and marvelous execution. Many people complain about bugs but I haven't found one, it works like a charm.  People complaining guns are not powerful are expecting this to be Skyrim-like in the manner that you can play any class and level any skills and be equally as efficient as with anything else. If you spend your skill points on the RIGHT areas, you will be a complete powerhouse by the time you reach level 20. I personally prefer running a stealth/explosives/rifles class, and while I can pretty much kill anything in a few hits, trying to use my fists or a machete will take me several minutes to kill my target.  Exploring is some of my favorite things about this game. On my first playthrough, I only walked to my objective the fastest way I could, fast-traveling all the time. You do not get the same appreciation this way. On my second playthrough, which I am still on, I made it a point to only fast-travel to a location 5 walking minutes away. It's so satisfying, I'm finding things I would've NEVER even thought existed in my first playthrough. The setting, the characters, the writing, it's all so fantastic. Walking along the highway, nearing death, and finding an abandoned convenience store with some supplies is one of the biggest satisfaction in modern gaming. The writing is the setting, in many ways.  Morality isn't black-and-white, which is always a good thing. The factions are really well-done, with the exception of Caesar's Legion. NCR is okay, but the only true ways to go are House and yourself.  I haven't played ALL the DLCs yet, but I will give my opinions on the ones I have played, Dead Money and Lonesome Road. Dead Money, when first playing through it, was a chore. But looking back on it, it was MEANT to be a chore. It's some of the most hardcore challenges in modern gaming. Where the gameplay isn't that good (unless you main melee and sneak), the writing REALLY excels. Dead Money is the epitome of excellent writing in FO:NV AND FO3. The characters and their motivations are so well-done. I could spend hours talking about Dean, Dog/God, and Elijah. Also you could make some mad caps at the Sierra Madre.  Lonesome Road was a mixed bag. The gameplay was awesome, and the enemies were pretty challenging, but ED-E is one of the best companions in the game, so that makes it a bit easier. The Divide truly feels like a wasteland, which it should for story reasons. I didn't really get the story, but reading about it online, I can see why. Most of the events alluded in Lonesome Road were mentioned in some parts of the main quest and there was an overarching storyline about Ulysses throughout all the DLCs. That final fight with Ulysses was amazing.  Graphics-wise, very 'Ehhhh'. The brown gets really repetitive. Animations are a bit stiff, character models are iffy, textures are bland. I understand you can fix most of that with mods if you wish to, but I've been playing completely vanilla.  All in all, if you haven't played this game, you definitely should, it gets really cheap during sales. And even then, it's pretty freaking cheap already, I mean you're paying 20 dollars for over 40 hours of gameplay minimum.",1,0

296710,Monstrum ,"my god...  The fear rating on this is 9/10 and that's saying something, since I basically eat horror games for breakfast. It does its job really well, and I have a feeling it will scare players who legit try not to get scared. I have not had my heart pumping like this in a long time. The randomization just adds so much to the game, keeping both the game play and the fear fresh. even though 50% of the ship is not randomized, it does its job well of getting you lost.  the fear for me turns up to 12/10 when you use the oculus rift. I've never shook so hard in my life. you can imagine why.   the game play is solid. and I've never felt this much freedom in a horror game of this style, even more so than Outlast or Alien Isolation. Because you can go ANYWHERE you want on the ship, which ramps up the horror even more cause you feel like it REALLY IS up to you to go and figure out how to save yourself from the situation. no hand holding, other than with helping understand how to repair something (via shopping list to fix a submarine for e.g.). your own plans, your own decision, your own fault for getting what you need to get and failing to do so from monsters with there own plans as well.  Seriously, the monsters are really smart and I can tell by the way they behave. If there are multiple places that I could be hiding, they'll just skim through all the rooms without checking under beds and stuff to save time and to try and keep me from running from room to room. And if they have a really good idea of where you are, they'll stick around in your room for a long, long time until they find you or give up. they're not there to be spooky, they are legit trying to eat your face to the best of their abilities. It gives you a true sense of being hunted, one which few horror games have achieved.  there tends to be a bug or two, but they are very rare and will never break game-play. In fact none of the bugs revolve around the player, so you'll never die a cheap buggy death. any bugs I've found revolve around the monsters, which is good cause you'll need all the help you can get :P  Each monster has its own strengths and weaknesses, but no matter how well you know the monster, it can still catch you completely off guard. Remember, they are SMART. I remember a monster chased me down the side of the ship on the top deck, and I went into a red locker on the port side. I saw it rush past my locker. It stopped at the corner up ahead, sensing that it wasn't chasing a running target any more. so it began retracing its steps, trying to figure out where I went. it went back and forth in front of my locker. and each pass it went slower and slower and slower. I knew that one of those passes will result in it figuring out that I was right beside it the whole time. and I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself with the realization. I ran the moment it did another pass on my locker, but even though I lost it, I was still shaking.  get the ♥♥♥♥ing game. it's a real gem amongst the 2015 ocean of 'scary' game wannabe's.  ",1,0

Aside from the standard puzzles there is a hidden-object minigame where you have to PUT items into the screen. A nice idea, but sometimes annoying - logic is subjective, just because the developer thought it's obvious that X goes to Y, doesn't mean it's obvious for me. (Basically the same problem you have with object names - is 'bat' the animal or the club? Is 'club' the weapon or the card suit, etc...)

238320,Outlast,"Outlast is like the texas chainsaw massacre meeets one flew over the cookoo's nest, expect theres more blood, gritty sadism and geunie terror. I can honestlty say I've never ♥♥♥♥ my pants playaing a video game, however....well ok that didn't happen but still there were some seriously dodgy moments. My advice? don't play this game in your sunday best... just in case. In fact if you suffer from a heart condition I wouldn't play this game either, I jumped out of my stkin atl least twice on the first playing. Ofcourse like all horror games you eventually desensitise to all the scary scary ♥♥♥♥ my pants geniune terror moments, but Outlast did a very good of keeping me immersed and emotiontal attacthed to what was going on. One reason for this is the atmospheres the game gernerates is supperb, every sound, the floorboard creakiong the broken glass underfood the psycho eske soundtrack, which by the way is perfectly timed to suit the mood of the moment, it all rachets up the tension and keeps it there, making yoiu allways worried about whats around the corner whats coming up next? what new saddistic horror have the twisted minds that made this game got in store for next? At times itf feels more cinema than game. The graphics are no let down either, with alot of the game veiwed with a infra-red camcorda it all looks eerily real. Another cool aspect of the game is that way it is played, this is no hack'n'slash where you are the triamphant hero wading through yet another pile of freshly made corpses, oh no, in this game when you come against on of the macrabe monstrosites that are lurking in the shadows you can either run, or hide, or die. Those are you options, nuff said.  So yes ofcourse I reccomend it, in its way it is a very thoughtful game, which has been carefuly crafted to pull the player in and be more of a cinnematic experiance in which you take part, an interactive story that rewards you with survival, and therefore more story. This is the way I allways hoped computer games would go, towards a geniune artform rather than the mindlesss blockbuster shoot em ups/ rpg farming for gear wtih slightly better numbers that litter the steam store. Most are totatly worthless. I suppose at elast in that sense the computer games industry simple mirrors the movie industry. But there are excepections. Outlast is one.",1,0
248610,Door Kickers,"After proudly playing this game for several hours I can say: This game is amazing. It has an immense amount of missions with several different scenario's where the same tactics don't work every single time, so don't worry about things getting repetative, the only way you can upgrade your squad is via completing missions and using the stars you gain to purchase weaponry, armor, tactical items, excetera, so that means you have a reason to do your best.

278360,A Story About My Uncle,"A Story About My Uncle is a game made in 2014. It quickly grasped eager players and online gamers and held them tighter than a grappling hook shooting you 50 foot up above your designated area.  PROS: Beautiful Graphics and Style.  One of the best looking games I've played all year. I will defend this game for this aspect because of just how amazing it looks.  Unique Gaming Mechanics.  I have not played another game with the same aspect of this. Seriously, look up 'Game with Grappling and Super Jump Mechanics' and you probably won't get many results.  Smooth Gameplay.  (Most of) the gameplay was amazing and very smooth. Maybe it's just my computer but, dammit, it looks so beautiful!    Yeah.. Those were the ros. Into the Cons!    CONS: Uninterresting Storyline.  I'm sorry if it's just me, but it's hard to get invested into the characters and general storyline of the game. I could not get invested into the story at all. On top of this, it's painful when you lose the ability to do everything for a little 'cutscene' that takes a few minutes. What's the point of taking away our powers if we're only going to be talking for one minute?  TERRIBLE Window (Yes, this is very nit-picky).  Jesus, it was a PAIN to actually be able to play with this window. One minute the bottom of the screen has a black line across it and the next, I'm sat there watching the window go from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed' every few seconds.  Bad Grappling Mechanics. I don't mean the grappling itself, I mean certain parts with it.  First off, the reach for some rocks are extremely far and others are extremely close. Why is this? It would be easier to have them all set to a certain point.  Secondly, Jesus, it takes forever. It can't be just me who's having this issue where, one minute I'll be flying across the map and the next, I'll have my buzz killed because it takes FOREVER to reach where you're going with it.  Repeating Areas. I don't mean the areas repeat themselves, but I've found that.. It all looks the same. I see little to no variety in the surroundings or areas I'm in. The beginning of the game had a house, houses on the rocks, moving rocks, a village, etc. However, it pretty much becomes you jumping from rock to rock.    All in all, this wasn't a terrible game, however, if you ask me, I wouldn't really recommend it.  4.5/10",-1,0

105600,Terraria,"Over 300 hours on this game, and I've barely scratched the surface.  Terraria is one of those games that I didn't bother with for the longest time. It looked like Minecraft in two dimensions. Since Minecraft already struggled to hold my interest for any enduring length of time, I couldn't imagine why I would want to have that same experience in a flattened environment.  Well, Terraria is nothing like Minecraft. Here are some of the things that I think make Terraria special:     More sense of purpose.  Sandboxes are great, but it's nice to have some sense of  meaning  to your open-ended virtual existence. Minecraft never really delivered here, though the Ender Dragon was obviously an attempt at instilling some endgame goal to the world. Terraria, on the other hand, seems to draw you into a story arc that is minimally defined and yet subtley compelling.    More going on.  Random events and increasingly difficult boss encounters keep things interesting, so you never feel like you're stuck in the drudgery of 'dig holes, hide from monsters, rinse and repeat'. It's invigorating to have a blood moon rise and fight off swarms of monsters thoughout the night, and finally make it to dawn's first light, only to have a goblin army attack from the west. You never know what the new day is going to bring!    Great in-game guidance.  The Guide allows you to learn about the crafting options as you go, without ever needing to consult a wiki. If you like the joy of discovery and don't want to spoil it by consulting wikis, The Guide is a great idea, because you can only learn about those crafting things once you have at least one raw material already in hand. This allows you to incrementally learn about more and more items in the world as you continue to expand your horizons and gain new items.    More monsters.  I love zombies, skellies, spiders and creepers as much as the next block-headed guy, but more diversity is certainly appreciated. Terraria boasts a huge collection of monsters, many of them specific to different biomes, which keeps things interesting as you travel around, both above-ground and underground.    MOAR STUFF.  The gamut of items in the game is staggering. And again, I've barely scratched the surface.    Awesome music.  Resonance Array certainly deserves the credit it gets in the title card. The music in Terraria manages to strike a perfect balance: it sounds retro without sounding cheesy. The tracks are interesting to listen to and change with biome, weather, boss encounter, or random event. They really add to the feel of the game. I should mention that the sound effects are equally well balanced, with makes the entire soundscape of Terraria a treat.   So, while I have yet to see all of the bosses, and I've yet to try multiplayer, I've thoroughly enjoyed my 300+ hours of Terraria, and I'm pretty sure I'll have another 300 hours logged before I finally move on. It's a great, relaxing game that manages to stay fresh long after Minecraft would start to feel tedious.",1,0
4500,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl,"One of the very few shooting games I've liked.

The Story and side quests are over average and funny to play. The dialoges are great. The combat system is balanced. Personaly the game is maybe a bit too easy (Sadly this seems to became a trend in the games industry). The multiplayer is a good feature. The only problems with this game are the framedrops of body parts glitched into textures and a bug i experienced by joining a friends game while being in a boss fight. I was still in the arena but the boss was gone (started a new story which fixed this problem). All in all this is one of the best games i played this year.

In that case my appologies for the following, but to me this game was not worth the (little) money I paid. Unfortunatley, Incandescent is an uninspired shoot 'em up. The graphics are simple copies of other 'neon style' shooters. The enemies are repetitive and just disturbing, but not challenging. In several situations there is no visual/ acustic feedback, including when dying or when hitting bosses. It is not really difficult, I had a hard time when getting bored after a few minutes (100000 score) to finally loose all ships, while still doing a bit of resistance, until I gave up at 200000 score. Afterwards I was hard thinking about anything new, special, well implemented, fun of this shooter, but I was not able to find anything. Not recommendable.

322330,Don't Starve Together,"Well, Don't Starve Together. I love this game, and I don't think I need to point out why, over 30 thousand people have already pointed it out. Impeccable music, unique and incredible art style, brutal yet rewarding gameplay. I have to say, it's hard to stop playing this game, and not in a Skinnerbox method, Candy Crush/WoW kind of 'I can't stop playing.' I'm a total survival + sandbox game junkie, and this fills both of those needs. It's hard for me to name a single problem with this game itself, but I'll get to the problems with it that aren't Klei's fault later on.   ---The Game Itself, and what it's like.--- The game is a blast, full of tough decisions, engaging gameplay, and stress. Lots of stress. Don't Starve Together has you managing a few main things, this being your HP, your Hunger, your Sanity, your temperature, your wetness, and probably most importantly, time. You need to go throughout the world, collecting any resource you can simply to survive. Survive intervals of hound attacks, which get more frequent as time goes on. Survive full moons, where normally friendly pigmen become ...werepigs. Spooky. You'll travel throughout an unforgiving world and eventually set up a camp where you can unlock new recipes to help you survive. Later on, winter will start. In this, plants grow more slowly, days are shorter, nights are longer, and you can very easily freeze. After a long time, you can improve your base and make surviving 'easier'. It's a grand world of fear and surprises, I'm only scraping the surface.  ---Playing Singleplayer--- Playing singleplayer is great, but if you wanted to do that, Don't Starve is better for it. It's considerably easier, and it even has another gamemode, Don't Starve Shipwrecked that... Well, I'm getting off topic. Singleplayer is great, but it's not where Don't Starve Together is centered.  &gt;&lt;~~~Playing Multiplayer~~~&gt;&lt;  Ooh, fancy.  Multiplayer is where Don't Starve Together both shines and falls flat. If you gather some friends and make a private server, it's a total blast! Some of the most fun I've had in a while. Spoiler alert, having food isn't as easy with 6 people. You can survive together, help each other, and if one of you dies, one can revive another for a relatively small price. Truly, in multiplayer, cooperation is key. And that's exactly why public multiplayer is the only real flaw in the game.  The game's community, if you haven't heard about it before, is... Well, it's something else. Over half of the people who play the game are imbecilic and lazy, or just game-ruining for a good laugh. If they don't play well or even decently, they're probably stealing your stuff, destroying your base, or literally just sitting around doing nothing!  True story if you care to listen, actually, I was once in a server that made it until late winter. We even defeated the deerclops, a major boss in Don't Starve. One of the players who lived in our base hadn't really accomplished much. The player that had helped our base grow the most was asking him politely to do something, and he didn't respond. I gave him a golden axe, and asked him to chop some trees for logs. He took it, and did nothing, instead asking for food. The other person started yelling at him to do something. Again, he did absolutely nothing. We ended up kicking him.  It gets MUCH worse than that, however. People just join, ask if they can join your base, or asking for key resources, with varying levels of grammatical errors. If you refuse, they'll give a quick 'f*** u ur a n00b' and then proceed to either leave, or whine and complain until kicked, or until they inevitably die because they weren't actually playing the game.  ~~~Conclusion/TL;DR~~~ DST is an incredible game blending fun mechanics and stressful decisions. You definitely should buy it if you have friends willing to play with you. If not, then buying the singleplayer Don't Starve would be better... This game isn't worth it for public multiplayer. About 1 in every 6 servers you join will have a decent game waiting for you. Just about everything in the game itself is flawless... If you can take the community.  So, get ready for a fun night with friends. Deal with sanity, monsters, hounds, and especially other players. But most of all... Don't Get Caught Out In The Darkness Without A Torch. Can't wait for that game.",1,0

319480,Odallus: The Dark Call,"All of the visual style of a NES game with few of the headaches.   It's challenging, but not too challenging. As you level your character up, you'll go back to previous levels to find new secrets and unlock new locations which. The levels are well done and don't become tedious. Enemies are tough, but fair. Bosses are fun, and you can tank some of them if you're fast enough. The controls are solid, they don't allow you to overpower the enemies with spamming attacks, so you must plan carefully and be patient.   The story is pulpy but mysterious and interesting enough to keep you going.  The game seems to have some bugs on some systems. I found that VJOY was interfering with my xbox controller, so I disabled Vjoy. I also found that the game didn't play well with Steam overlay on, so I disabled that as well. Since doing those minor work arounds, the game has performed perfectly. The developer also seems responsive to issues and releases regular patches.   Good Game.",1,1

329430,State of Decay: Year-One,"I find all these negative reviews a bit unfair and misleading for the game and for new players as almost everyone base their negative review on faultered/not reached hopes and hypes. If we are to review ONLY the new parts of the game, then it's one thing. But if we are to review this as a whole game, for new and unaware players, then all this criticism are misplaced. Therefore these negative reviews is a shot to the head on a really great game.  If you are new to this game and you like the Zombie/survival genre, then this is (in my opinion) one of (if not THE) the best game there is to date. You get to survive/live in a pretty realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic zombie-virus outbreak. Vehicles, basebuilding, team-management, permadeath and scavaging. Done in a really genial way. Even with some RPG elements!  What needs to be fixed is the framrate/optimization issue. When travelling by car the game does not run very well, a problem I never had with the original. And a very personal opinion of mine, as I understand the hordes (maybe zombie overall) spawnrate has been increased. One of the (by me) strongest sides of SoD compared to other games in the same genre is that there is peaks of intensity. Your not overun 24/7, the world can seem silent and peaceful one minute and then hell breaks loose the next. I really hope it will stay that way.  So.

EDIT: After finding out that the automatic voice chat (which is horrible quality and can't be disabled in game) was the cause of the crashing, my friends and I specifically selected our mics in an external chat app and picked a default microphone which wouldn't transmit anything so it wouldn't be detected in-game. Now we've played for about 4 hours and are loving it. PLEASE add an option from the settings menu to disable in-game voice chat. It is my only complaint.",1,0
113020,Monaco,"Monaco takes the style of the classic pacman gameplay where you collect loot in a top down view and makes it 10 times more fun, involved, and frantic, wither you're playing alone, or with friends.  The goal of each level is to go through a series of 'floors' of a location and collect all the trophies, then escape. However, this is quite easily done, and most if not all players will eventually decide to start clearing floors, which involves you collecting all the coins on each floor, as well as the trophies, before moving onto the next. Clearing a whole level is a fun challenge that rewards you with a harder version of that level.  The game plays quite differently on Singleplayer than it does on Multiplayer most of the time. If you're someone who loves stealth and likes to take it slowly and perfectly, then singleplayer is for you, where some obsticles will require a small plan if you want to get past it unnoticed. Multiplayer is more fast paced, with almost always something going wrong. You'll quickly find 4 players running around the level hiding in bushes and reviving each other while being chased by dogs, helicopters, guards and more - it's a great laugh.  The game has a whole bunch of content to keep you going for hours - just look at my playtime - 100 hours (almost!). There's 3 campaigns, each of which can be played on a normal mode, and a zombie mode where even civillians try to kill you, then there's custom levels, which are made by you and other players alike. Custom levels means there's a level editor which will also keep you busy if that's your thing - its loads of fun to design a place to rob, believe me!  All in all, Monaco is a great game to pick up and play for an hour or two whenever you want. When you start out give it a few hours so you can get used to the art style, which can confuse a lot of people at first, and make sure you play more than the first few levels - they're mainly just tutorial levels!",1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"tl;dr? This is an actual negative review of Isaac. The story is unnecessarily dark which leads to only polarizing its audience more so than just the game would. The actual game has no controller support, which is dumb. It personally seems repetitive to me regardless of the rouge-like elements and got boring fast.   The Binding of Isaac's story is highly juvenile but just the fact that I’m seeing people call the story good is making me scratch my head it isn’t good. The dark themes in this game are highly unnecessary for what the game really is; a rouge-like dungeon crawler. The game sure has the Newgrounds feel to it, but what it’s missing is the humor, instead of having a dark comedy vive like how I thought it was going to be, it seems to be a lot more focused on the DARK part of that. The story is almost like it’s both trying to be taken seriously and not at the same time in the same parts which makes it both not funny and laughable at the same time.   Of course, you’re probably wondering why I’m harping on the story so much when it’s obviously not the purpose of the game. Reason is, because of the way the story it seems to only polarize its audience with one side either not caring about the story, or liking it because they’re hard-core atheists who like anything anti-religion; and the other side being people who aren’t comfortable with the story, or feel it’s distracting to the game. Again, this polarization seems very unnecessary since the story is a very minor part of the game. I feel like the game could have still had its own unique identity with a different story.  The Binding of Isaac really has nothing too wrong with it mechanically, though. Other than the fact that it has no controller support (some people don’t want to download a separate program just to play the game with a controller) and the game really is a controller game, the keyboard controls feel awkward as all hell. Besides, it might just be me, but even with the rouge-like elements the game feels very repetitive and it bored me pretty quickly.    ",-1,0

I'm not saying that I haven't gotten some enjoyment out of the game and that others are'nt enjoying theirs, I got the discount also.

304650,Sunless Sea,"I love Fallen London and I really enjoyed the story aspect of what I saw in my brief trial of Sunless Sea. The writing has all the strange flair of Fallen London, which is both this game's and FL's greatest strength. But I'm the kind of person who dies all the darn time even in regular games that don't assure you right off the bat, like Sunless Sea does, that 'dying is normal and part of the game, it's okay', so you can bet I died a whole bunch of times here.   Dying  is  okay, but it can also get frustrating. I don't mind the failure--I mind the repetitive part of the beginning-game, where you have to revisit the same islands in basically the same order, travel the same paths, and read many of the same (admittedly wonderful) text snippets (even if the stories do change sometimes).  Permadeath works better when the world is truly randomized on each new life. Permadeath games should also make you go 'DAMN IT. All right,  one more  round and I'll definitely get it this time...' Unfortunately, I didn't really get that sense here.  Despite all that, Sunless Sea is a beautiful-looking game filled with cool writing. If you're patient and clever, maybe you'll die less often than me and enjoy it more.  P.S. I HIGHLY recommend Fallen London.   Rating: 2/5",-1,0
241540,State of Decay,"Very good premise. Well done game for an indie, even though the gameplay gets stale after quite some time. The ending for the original game and base customization could have been better. They even added storage at the backs of vehicles with the Lifeline DLC. Though I think the Lifeline DLC is heaps better than the original game, it was buggy as hell. I keep on getting stuck into walls while trying to save survivors or soldiers, the mission campaigns get stalled (with the original game as well, though already fixed it. But it was still pretty bad that I've to wait for months for them to fix the bug), etc. Would recommend to surival-zombie enthusiasts, though the bugs are really cringe-worthy and game-dropping.

242920,Banished,"This is a really enjoyable building game - it reminds me a lot of Settlers, without the fighting. If that sounds boring, then I will say that looking after your people in this game is pretty tough. They will die very, very easily, and they don't reproduce especially quickly - your previously thriving settlement can be a ghost town in no time at all.   But if all goes well, and you manage to juggle, plan and manage properly, your people will thrive, and it's one hell of a feeling of achievement.   On top of that, responsive chatty developer - and a bonus for me - it looks beautiful on very low end hardware.",1,0

291480,Warface,"So after around 14 hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that warface is probably one of the funnest (I know it's not a word) multiplayer shooters I've ever played (Aliens vs predator is my favourite co-op shooter). It's fast pased and addictive, but is balanced to the point that it never feels like a cod re-skin (And it's not like we need anymore cod in the world -_-) Sure, the leveling up isn't super fast, and unlocking guns is pretty slow, but the gameplay is what keeps bringing me back.   The optimization of warface is amazing, my laptop runs on setting ixed between high and low, and it runs at a buttery smooth 60 fps (even exceeding 60fps most of the time). This isn't a very hard game to run, but don't come into it expecting your 2000 toshiba laptop to run it on very high at 200fps.

Also, the game looks and plays beautifuly even on low range ( i guess ) machines like mine, so it's probably very well optimized ( but don't take my word, i'm far from knowing about it ). Definitely recommended.  Plays best with a controller too.  For safety, and for you to be sure if it will run well, about the technical part, the game runs at full stuffs on my PC, 1920x1080 res, 60 fps. ( i only know about it cause the Nvidia thingy keeps that little number in the upper left corner, so yeah )  My PC being pretty old, so you probably can enjoy this one even if yours is too  Core i5 something something 2 gtx 660 ti twin frozr something  ( no idea how to make the 2 work together, but they do sometimes i guess, on their onw o.O, i don't mind much ) 8gb ram memory 2 tb hard drive  ( I myself don't know a lot about PCs and dont mind much, my brohter built this one for me about 2 to 3 years ago )",1,0

419460,"That Dragon, Cancer","That Dragon, Cancer is a perfect example of how the Video Game Genre can be utilized to great effectiveness in order to relay thought and emotion. And that it is very much an art form in the truest sense of the word when done right. And That Dragon, Cancer gets it right. A narrative-driven game that focuses very much on the story and not the gameplay, That Dragon, Cancer achieves easily what hundreds of games in the past have attempted to achieve. Through a minimalist art design, it retains focus on the narrative itself, which is not only based on but the sole focus of a true story of a family and their battle against the cancer ravaging a young boy.   The graphics and level design of the game overall magnificently accentuate the thoughts and emotions that the game is attempting to convey. The simplistic gameplay mechanics might seem droll to some at first glance, but this reviewer took it as a way for the game designers to accentuate the age of the child that was the focus of the game, his battle, his family’s titanic struggle, how inspirational the boy had become to so many people.

I am currently 50 hours in at the time of this review and I am only now confident in my ability to understand the way this game works and play it with a certain level of skill.  It's clunky sometimes, yes, but its an enjoyable experience all around.   The thrill of controlling an entire row of forces and executing your strategy is wonderful.   There are many different scenarios and variations to play, it isn't just one single player 3 day repeating mission.  The difficulties of the AI are more than just easy, medium, hard, It's a selection based on how aggressive and how skilled you want the AI to be. Do you want to AI to defend and be masterful at renforcements and positioning? Do you want the AI to be aggressive but not wise? You can set that as you see fit.   I'm not going to list pros and cons, you can read other reviews for that. I won't deny the weaknesses put forth by some reviewers, but I still absolutely love this game and recommend it.

I'm a MTG player, and I adore it, once I saw this was a thing (especially for free) I had to have a go. Even my boyfriend decided he was going to play too. :D I have to say that I was dissappointed that there was a fatal error when I tried to play on my laptop (With no fix that worked for me as I'm playing on Windows 10), and now I can play it, I'm dissappointed with the graphics bugs. (I end up playing against a black screen...) I think it's a crying shame that we haven't heard anything from the developers about a patch yet, even though it was promised last week (10th August). PLEASE FIX THIS. PLEASE! You have a great concept! Sort out the prices of booster packs to make it fairer for those of us who don't want to pay money, and give those that do, give them perks.

41000,Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter,"This remake has little differences to the gameplay from the original, except the fact that it has a new engine and better looking graphics. It still keeps it's same old fun and challenging factors while its difficulty can be quite frustrating to deal with most of the times when you decided to play on difficulties that are beyond Normal (I've beaten the whole campaign on the Hard difficulty), which can pretty much turn the game into a trial and error fest, so if you're new to this game, then I would suggest you play on Normal or Easy if you don't like going through any struggles of dying a lot. The weapons are pretty fun to use, but if you don't use them in the right situations, then you're going to have so much trouble since you'll be fighting a lot of hordes of enemies on-screen while using the best weapons against that type of horde in order for them not to get close to you or overwhelm you, and there are a few of enemies that you will hate fighting against. It can be a little boring if you fight the same enemies over and over again. Overall, the game is good while it is pretty fun.  I can't say that the game is worth getting again if you had the original version, but if you're a hardcore Serious Sam fan, then you should add this to your library. As for anyone else, get it if you like a very fun FPS game like this one.",1,0

232430,Gone Home,"I don't normally take the time to review games, since I generally agree with reviewers to an extent that there's no need, but this game deserves better than the page of reviews I just read through.  Here's the basic gist: This is an atmospheric storytelling horror game. No, this is not a cheap ♥♥♥ jump scare generator. You will also not be gleefully crushing your way through hundreds of generic zombie-like-monsters. It's about a 2 hour experience, and yeah, no more replay than a short story or movie. I'd agree that I wouldn't spend $20 on it, but it is worth $10, or at least $5. You explore and read through a story, in a scary environment. I'll explain further, but if you want my advice, just grab this game and go through it without preconceptions. I had no idea what I was getting into, and I thoroughly loved the experience.  First, the story. There are a lot of people that can't be bothered to slow down and take in an environment when they play a game; people that will slam through a Bethesda game running from one quest marker to the next, completely ignoring any piece of in-game text that doesn't grant a skill point, then say the game had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story. If that's you, if you just don't have patience to dig around a desk and look for clues, or if you can't immerse yourself in a game, you won't enjoy this game. The key to enjoying this game is letting yourself be absorbed into the environment. There are no cutscenes, it's not that kind of game. Get into it, you'll enjoy it.  Regarding the horror aspect: I guess 'Horror' games are pretty popular. There's a formula, right? Oh no, it's dark. Creepy noise, gore, monster, maybe jumpscare, reload - some interactive iteration of a tired B-grade horror genre. I don't know, I'm not a professional horror-game-consumer. I consider this a spoiler, so if you want the best experience, please don't read on, but I'm pretty sure there's nothing in this game that will kill you. There's no monster, or ghost, or headshot-fodder. It's just the atmosphere and your mind.   What terrifies kids about the dark in their closet or under their bed? Not actual monsters (sorry, spoilers), just hundreds of thousands of years of evolved instinct. Don't go into this game thinking that there's only one way to do horror in a video game. The atmosphere of this house will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you if you let it. Such is the nature of fear, the real monsters are inside your head. The best horror stories know that and will play on it, and the developers did a great job of that here.  This game is sufficiently well designed and written to be both a spookfest and a moving story. I highly recommend it.",1,0

The puzzles are fun, the level design is really clever, and the ambient sounds and music adds so much to the atmosphere of the game. The entire game can easily be completed in a few hours, but there are some really fun achievements that will easily double your gameplay (I earned nearly all of the achievements in 5 - 6 hrs).

I haven't played a game everyday since fallout 3 came out. The subtle and not-so subtle jabs at fantasy staples are great. They bring a smile and the stories, quests, and conversations are all enjoyable. Combat is a challenge but not impossible by any stretch. This is what it's all about.  Fun. Relaxing and exciting at the same time. No real frustrations... you may die, just load from a save and try better or different tactics. So far, when things don't go as planned, I have just rolled with it. Let the story eveolve however it happens.  A bit of the unknown = fun. Game looks as good as it plays... 9 out 10 ",1,0
255070,Abyss Odyssey,"First, the art of the game caught my attention and after watching a few videos, I decide to give it a try. I was a bit disappointed at first b/c I was expecting something else (something like Dragon's Crown). However, after a few more hours, I am hooked. The game system remind me of Japanese dungeon RPG where you lose your progress and items when you die, but in this game, you get to keep the level/skills, money, and souls/characters for vs mode. Many have complaints about this mechanic in the forum, but I think it works just fine. Also, the game is designed for multiple play-through, so don't expect it to be long to reach the final boss (took me about an hour on the first try). Just think of this game as Super Smash Brothers Melee type of game with a fun single player mode for collecting characters.  As for VS mode, I haven't try yet since I am still trying hard to convince my friends to get this game (they all are waiting for the next sale. Bunch of cheap asses). However, I hope the developer would tune/balance characters for the VS mode as time go by and hoping the game would be in FTG tournaments.",1,0

418240,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,Game really similar to Commando but little bit less hardcore in difficulty (still really hard but you wont spend an entire day trying to figure out a level.).  Lot of objectives to do and some of them needs you to replay the map and kill targets a different way or avoid killing at all which gives you badges and achievements to unlock.   The enemies positions and patrols are really well made and you really have to act quickly to avoid detection. Sometimes you can drop rocks on their head and do some cool ''Accident'' types of death that are really funny when you manage to have a good timing.  Characters are different enough that you really want all of their different abilities in combat and use them wisely.  The attention to details is amazing and the mission environnement have a lot of variety.  So far so good i really enjoy it.,1,0
311480,Vertical Drop Heroes HD,"This a great game that's reminscent of other roguelikes except you're constantly going down. The only problem with this game is that it crashes all the time. This wouldn't be so bad if you could just pick up where you left off, perhaps at the start of the level, from when it crashed. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. You lose your hero and are forced to reroll a new one as if they had died. This is immensly frustrating as it can take a while to build up a hero and advance through the 10 levels in the game. At most I've gotten to the end of the 6th level only to have a crash just as I beat the boss. The money you earned stays though but that's not really any consolation if you were doing a run to try and beat the game. In those situations you won't have all that much money because you'll have been spending it on one run only buffs at shrines.   As long as the game is this unstable I can't recommend it.",-1,0

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"I've actually played this game at first on PS4, and what a wreck it was at the start. Not only was it locked at 30 FPS on consoles, Microsoft had an exclusivity deal with Ubisoft. This meant that PS4 players had to wait a month before actually getting any DLC and/or updates. Glad I switched to PC and will not be going back. (PSN sucks. And it's stupid).  I've been a player since the game was released and what a bumpy ride that was. I remember participating in the Firearms/Stamina meta of 1.0, the Sentry SMG meta of 1.1, and so on. It was very fun back then, and is even more so now.  1.4 has finally made the game balanced not in only PVP, but in PVE (mainly focused on PVE though). No longer do you require to have a Tanktician to carry you through content, no longer do you require Smart Cover to even  try  Challenge mode.  You want to be that guy that carries around a Flame Turret in PVE? Go ahead! There's a dedicated Gear Set for it. Want to use a Ballistic Shield to be a tank? Do it! As of 1.5 there's a Gear Set for it! Want to place down your Mobile Cover to provide more opportunities to take cover? Use it! (Please don't. AI fires at you and not the cover making it useless. They also walk around you a lot. I've personally tested this and it is  very  underwhelming).  There is so much diversity in this game now! No longer will you get melted by an SMG, now it's a shotgun or LMG. (As of 1.5 it is now Assault Rifles due to Armour Shred being in PVP). Shotguns are viable. LMGs are viable. Pistols are viable. SMGs? They kinda suck now, but are still fairly viable. Skill builds are even worth it now. I've been personally using the broken Smart Cover + Overheal + Triage in 1.2 before it became popular. BFB Sticky bombs are now  viable  for PVE content along with Seeker Mines. How awesome is that? (Explosions are now everywhere. It's like Micheal Bay was given the ropes to the skills in the game).  The developers actually listen for once and if you have this game on PC you get the added bonus of participating in a PTS for future updates. This means that you will get to try out patches before it is released and this will let the developers know what works and doesn't and they will balance them accordingly.  If you want to play a loot-based Action-RPG that will make you grind for hours on end for a goddang vest that's chance is probably 5% of dropping along with some RNG sprinkled on top that makes you even more frustrated when all of the rolls suck and even then the rolls don't coincide with whatever build you're trying to get and even then when you try to reroll the stats the RNG is even worse and all it gives you are the lower ends of the rolls on and   FOR CRYING OUT LOUD JUST GIVE ME THE ARMOUR STAT! THERE'S ONLY FOUR THAT CAN ROLL AND ALL YOU GIVE ME IS HEALTH, EXOTIC DAMAGE RESILIANCE AND PROTECTION FROM ELITES?   ...I love this game.  Try it out. If it ain't your cup of tea, feel free to look elsewhere. If you like it, welcome to The Division, Agent.",1,0

313740,Sakura Spirit,"Sakura Spirit is an indie Visual Novel (henceforth abbreviated VN) developed by Winged Cloud and published by Sekai Projects. It's a short go, as completing it won't take more than a couple of hours. Sakura Spirit is a fan-service laden VN that follows the story of a young man, Gushiken Takahiro, who falls asleep in a shinto temple and awakens to find himself in a fantasy, spirit filled version of medieval Japan. Takahiro must find a way to his own world by helping the denizens of the one he finds himself in. The review:  Breakdown: Graphics: 8/10 Very pretty stills, good character design and overall quality artwork.  Sound: 5/10 Pretty standard VN stuff. As frequently seems the case with VN's, some nice pieces that get badly overplayed.  Story: 1/10 Not really much here. No interaction (only one choice to be made in the entire playthrough and it has no effect on story). Story is only modestly interesting and took me several sessions to power through out of general boredom. Personal preference note: I don't like games that are ostensibly set in Japan with Japanese characters but use American/Western references (pop culture, etc...). It just feels like it takes you out of the setting too much. That phenomenon is somewhat prevalent here.  Charcters: 4/10 Some interesting characters with interesting interactions, but generally standard VN fare. Too many characters are one dimensional and forgetable.  Replayability: 1/10 Not gonna go through this one again. There is technically a branching path, but as stated early, it makes no difference in the story itself. The story is simply not interesting enough for me to want to read it again.  Overall (average score of all categories): 3.8/10 Ouch. Skippable by almost any standards as it doesn't hold much appeal for anyone except those looking for some eye candy. The backrounds and character designs are very pretty and some of the soundtrack is quite good (if a bit overdone), but the lack of story, length and replayability means that paying for it is hard to justify.",-1,0

397500,Labyronia RPG 2,Don't bother with this one no matter how cheap it is.  You can copy/paste my review of the first one here. It has all the same shortcomings and cliche story.  The thing that stands out as worse than the original is that the first 2 areas of the game are filled with ghosts that you cannot hurt. If you find yourself in combat with them you have to take damage for 2 turns until they give you the option to run. And if you aren't paying attention you hit the button to keep fighting and waste 2 more rounds as keep fighting is first in the list. It's the beginning of the game and that is a terrible way to sell it.  Do not buy this game.,-1,0

The developers have embraced the mod scene from the start and it's resulted in a game that you can tailor in a vast number of ways to adjust it to become what you prefer, something which is only going to get better as more mods are made.  If you liked earlier TW games, this is one of the best of the series. If you're a Warhammer fan, this is one of the best adaptations of that world I've ever seen.

391960,Super Mega Bob,"Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge.  Check out this review and others at Nouse Gaming:  http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/  ------------------------------------------------ Maybe I just haven't given this game enough of a chance. Maybe as Super Mega Bob continues it begins to unravel into an epic tale of love and loss with excellent mechanics and level design. Maybe it's a clever twist on the genre that you only find out several hours in (like Spec Ops: The Line). But if somebody who's almost professionally obliged to give the game at least an hour or so of play can't face anymore after about forty minutes you're doing something wrong.  The opening cutscene is a sweet if generic tale of some idealised world torn apart by some kind of explosion. You (as Bob) with your new pair of hands set out to find your best friend and lover. There's a lot of story strewn throughout the levels which you can find but again it's mostly fairly generic and uninteresting.  The game play has you floating around a world either killing 'x' enemies or collecting 'x' coins before reaching the end of the level. Enemies mostly ignore your existence and are more like obstacles to avoid and with the added time slow avoiding their bullets is easy. Not only this but almost immediately I found that my range far exceeded any opponents so I could easily sit back without risk. The game is shaken up a bit with the bosses and mini-bosses and these present the main challenge in the game, despite this they don't really add much only needing to avoid more difficult bullet waves and taking more damage.  The game seems to have a fairly in-depth upgrade system which is almost completely unneeded. You can both craft and get upgrades as drops which are mostly fractional upgrades to your speed, attack and range. However these RPG like upgrades just don't match the platformer but not really style of the game. The sound design also swaps between being boring and outright annoying. Many of the sound effects are ear splitting and the music tinny and annoying such that I turned off the sound after only a few levels.  The real moment that made me quit out was when I reached a room where I needed a bomb to reach the end of the level. However I had no bombs on me nor were any present in the room. In order to clear it I'd need to back track to a previous level pick one up. This kind of backtracking was simply something I wasn't prepared to do and probably means that there is more of it further in the game.  Super Mega Bob feels like someone's first project, and maybe it is! But if that's the case this game belongs on sites like congregate for free not on steam even for the relatively low price of just over £3. ",-1,1

247950,Sacred 3,"I would go to my Cousin's house and take my laptop so i can play Sacred 3 on xbox and he plays Witcher 2 on my laptop,and we had so much fun playing and staying awake all night for Sacred 3 coop on xbox,all this happened on the summer vacation June 2015 so today 25th of November 2015 i decided to get this game on pc,and here's my review of this pc version of the game.  POSITIVES *Nostalgia hit me so hard in the head when i played this game and i remembered them good ol' days.  *Decent enviroment design.  *I liked the classic arcade feel of the game overall.  *Decent looking skill animations.  NEGATIVES -The Audio is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad that it broke my headset,internally ofcourse.  - It clearly says FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT on the store page,but when i plugged my controller it didn't work at all and no the problem isn't my controller because its fully functional on other games.  -Same case with the controller,Mouse doesn't work sometimes.  - I did mention that the skill animations are decently looking on the pros section but the actual combat itself is all button mashing and gets repetitive really ♥♥♥♥ing quickly  - You can't play on Fullscreen,it just doesn't work even if you go to settings and enable fullscreen and highest resolution  it's still in windowed mode.  * The voice acting is so bad and the charecters try so hard to be funny and they're not. not at all  Refunded and im not going to talk about the sacred 2 genre migration,im not going to ♥♥♥♥ing do it.",-1,1

Only problem I had was the lack of new maps and characters. As well as the limited amount of strike supers and ultimate they give you. Other than that the game was great. I'd say the story is 10x better than the first game. And seeing your character from the first game is really awesome.,1,0

335670,LISA,"The only thing this game has going for it is its story. The writing is actually pretty well done. It can successfully make you feel uneasy, scared, sad, and any other number of emotions. The dark humor is also well-written (for the most part).  Unfortunately, the good writing of the game are muddled with terrible, TERRIBLE design choices from a mechanics perspective. In my opinion, these aren't just mechanics that could be done better or aren't great; they are actively detrimental to the experience. The game is so far up its own ♥♥♥♥ in respects to the dynamic, unpredictable random events. When sleeping at a campfire (how you restore HP and SP in the game), various random events can happen. At first, these are harmless and even give the unnerving feeling that you are never quite safe in the game. One of the first instances of these campfire events comes when you wake up, and there is an insane man standing over you, staring at you. While this idea starts off pretty neat, it eventually degrades into pure RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery. I'll wake up at the campfire only to see that one of my party members has abandoned me (never to return), or has been captured by a group of hoodlums. Rather than recruit a new party member and spending an hour leveling him up, or going to retrieve him from the hoodlum base, it's a hell of a lot easier to just reload to the last checkpoint (sometimes a 10 minute loss) and try my luck with the terrible campfire roulette again. These unforgiving and time-wasting perma-loss mechanics also appear in the form of a 'death' status effect (in which the party member is dead forever). This isn't 'challenging', it's an incentive to reload your save and infuriate you further. Now I get this is supposed to be done to be a reflection of the game world and how unrelenting it is, but it's ♥♥♥♥ing tedious.  Traveling in this game is done from a 2-D, platformer-esque perspective. In reality, there's nothing platformer about it. You hold right or left and occasionally climb ropes the developer put there to break up the monotony. That's all there is. Now, I would be alright with this if there was some interesting music or setpieces to hold my attention while I hold the right arrow key. But there isn't. Environments aren't varied; tiles are reused with nothing more than a simple pallette swap or different shading. The music is either extremely repetitive (I'm talking what sounds to be 20 second loops), extremely grating on the ears, or nonexistent. So, the traveling in between points of interest is boring as ♥♥♥♥. How does the developer account for this? Why, he makes it so that if you walk off the edge of a cliff, it's an instant game over! So just when my eyes are glazing over because I haven't done anything that can be considered a part of a game in over 15 minutes, a curveball is thrown my way when the platform I've been walking on drops off suddenly and I fall off. Nice.  As far as the battle system is concerned, it's Earthbound. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. You usually end up spamming the most powerful attack and/or one particular attack that causes tripping.  The game is also terrible at directing the player. The progression structure makes you go to three main areas, which is just a mountain composed of a lot of doors or crevices you enter (usually around 8). Which of these doors or crevices progress the story and which ones are setups for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'ha ha, I made you waste 10 minutes of your time' jokes, you ask? The answer is: there's no way to know. You just try all the doors and after a couple of dead ends, you get your answer.  After my 20th time falling off a cliff and getting a game over, I just looked up the ending on youtube. It's a shame the rest of the game is so bad, because the story and ending are well done.  inb4 I get 1000 downvotes for expressing dissent with this game",-1,1

323450,Alphadia Genesis,"I quite enjoyed this game, mainly because of character interactions. While I found some of the characters' logic to be a bit contradictory (particularly the main protagonist) it was a fun, not-particularly-brain-draining game to unwind with. The gameplay was enjoyable if you don't want to think too hard and I had fun levelling up the characters to unlock more of their 'break' skills.

107100,Bastion,"You play Kid who sets out on a mission to restore a land to which is once was. The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done.   The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly.   The weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon.   The characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle.   Another thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols. Overall this game is definitely a 10/10 for me.",1,0

391540,Undertale,"Once again, I could make this easy and make a reference from the game, but I won't.  Undertale is a much more deep game than I ever would've expected. A friend of mine bickered me constantly to buy this game and play it, I was put off by the rabid community that I had heard of. I bought this game, and I am very glad that I did.  While playing this game, I never thought of this game as an RPG. I don't feel like it's a game in the sense as you'd think, it's cheesy to call it an 'artpiece' but it's more than a game. During any other RPG, lets take another RPG like Final Fantasy. Think of just a random encounter in the very beginning of the game, it's just another thing to stomp over in your rampage to success and glory. In Undertale, each and every monster in the game has its own personality, making everything seem like it really is its own person. Undertale has a very interesting way of going through battles, namely, MERCY, the thing that everyone who says that Undertale is a masterpiece brings up. I think of it more than just an interesting game mechanic. It's a way to show everyone that hurting anything in your path is not the only option, heck, because of this game, I've wanted to try and get through Donkey Kong 64 without killing any enemies, although the bosses I will need to take down.  This game in short, is not just any game, it's a piece of art that challenges the norm and makes every choice you make seem important and impactful to every creature in the world, whether they are a main character or just a random enemy you would kill without a thought if it were any other game.",1,0

208090,,"This game has one of the best F2P models I have ever seen (sure it's not as good as TF2's, but then Edge of Reality aren't loaded like valve is). The ingame currencies consist of Blutes and Spacebux, Blutes are free and earned by playing the game, levelling up and through the Daily Prize (i'll come back to that later in the review), the Spacebux are bought with real money.   Most F2P games require you to purchase weapons with real money, but not Loadout. Every weapon and weapon customization in the game is completely free, no strings attached. So you're probably wandering, 'What are Spacebux used for then?', simple. Cosmetic items, Blute/XP boosts and extra Loadout slots and weapon slots.  The cosmetic items provide no advantage other than making your character look amazing. The XP/Blute boosts are not necessary and are aimed at people who don't have the time and/or patience to level up or grind blutes. The one gripe with Spacebux that I have is that you have all these different combinations of weapons, but you only get 3 loadout slots for free. This is NOT enough, 4 I could deal with but 3, that's not enough. I've got a healer loadout, an offensive loadout, a AoE loadout (flak rocket launcher with pyro). But i no longer have any loadout slots for a sniper loadout, shotgun loadout, hell a loadout I just want to mess about with. This is quite a big dissapointment, however the Spacebux aren't the most expensive paid currency i've seen in a F2P game.  The daily prize is a system that rewards players at the end of the 1st game of each day. You'll most likely be granted extra Blutes, but if you're lucky, you'll recieve a FREE cosmetic item. Yep, free. This makes playing the game each day worthwhile and I can see myself playing this daily for the next few months at LEAST (even if it is only just to play 1 game and get the reward).  The gameplay is amazing, it has plenty of gamemodes (with more being added). It even has a competetive mode. These things are impressive, but something more impressive is that the devs listen to their fans. They have livestreams where they physically read the chat comments and they give away items in the forms of codes (the codes can range from a Twitch shirt to a full cosmetic set).  TL:DR  Pro's:  - Great F2P model. - Great Devs, who listen to the game. - Fun gameplay. - Spacebux are fairly cheap compared to similar F2P games (*cough*battlefield heroes*cough*)  Con's:  - Doesn't give you enough Weapon/Loadout slots.",1,0

255420,,"I have played over one hundred hours of Magic 2014 and I loved it. Needless to say I pre-ordered Magic 2015 as soon as I could. Never do this. The game is a massive disappointment. If you wish to play a good Magic game get 2014.  Pros - Lots and Lots of cards - Decent graphics  Cons - NO TWO-PLAYER CO-OP - Stuck with a single deck choice (in 2014 there were at least 8 different decks) - Difficult to unlock cards - Only one type of game mode - Poor auto land tap (the automatic functions of the game do not preform even the most obvious moves) - Painful interface  Overall the game feels like it was thrown together in an effort to get it out with as little work done be the creators as possible. The myopic gameplay and single deck make the game become dull quickly when compared to earlier Duels of the Planeswalkers game. While the custom deck option is nice, it does not compensate for the lack of game modes. ",-1,0

226560,Escape Dead Island,"Genre - 3rd Person Survival Horror (Cel Shaded) I have enjoyed every single Dead Island game released on Steam thus far and this is no exception. Although it plays differently to the FPS original Dead Island games and the MOBA Epidemic. This is more centred around a story and sees you not only trying to survive the island but your own sanity with strange events being triggered, think of a cartoony Evil WIthin. I haven't completed the game yet so don't know the full story. Although this is good as stops me from spoiling it for you.  You get to use melee and ranged weapons and you will find various key items that allow you travese more and more of the Island. Sometimes this will make you go back to previous visited areas that were inaccessible before, so make notes as you go. The graphics although more cartoony than the other games look nice, as a fan of Cel Shaded graphics. The story will keep you interested and a few familar faces will pop into the game as you progress. I am over half way through and don't think this is an overly long game, although the Free DLC adds significant new content. However, if you are an achievement hunter, there is always plenty to go back for. I got the game on sale and think the original asking price was way to high, but if you can get at a fair price and are a fan of Dead Island games I would recommend giving this a whirl.",1,1

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"In my first game outside of the tutorial, one of the first civilizations I encountered was India, led by none other than Ghandi. Though we got along fairly well in the early- to mid-game, I knew of his reputation in past Civilization titles as a frighteningly fast aggressor who would not hesitate to nuke me if I angered him sufficiently. Thus, I resolved to beat him to it. Locking my tech sights on nuclear fission and fusion well in advance, I took great strides in accrlerating my scientific developments. Even through all of this, Ghandi and I remained friends... until the war with Russia. I had declared war on Russia on behalf of Japan, another ally of mine. Though Ghandi was supportive at first, as the war drew on, he grew distant, along with the rest of the world. It wasn't long before I was labeled a warmonger, and I knew there was no going back. As I nuked Russia's last bastion and razed it from the face of the earth, I knew that one way or another, this would end in blood. Multiple nations declared war on me for my warmongering, though most quickly backed down. Others did not. Scythia's lone city was erased in a surprise nuclear strike, followed by Norway after a foolish declaration of war by their archaic forces. Once these conflicts were done, my soldiers returned home, and I began to hope that I could perhaps salvage a peaceful victory. But it was not to be. Ghandi and the rest of the world still despised me, though I know not whether it was for my seemingly endless state of war, or the nuclear stockpile that I had begun constructing during the conflict with Russia and never bothered to stop. As turn 500 drew near, I noticed something... interesting. Between nuclear and thermonuclear bombs, I had a total of nine weapons of mass destruction at my disposal, with a tenth due to be finished on turn 498. At that point, India had exactly ten cities, all within nuking distance. It was then that I resolved to have my last hurrah. When the tenth bomb was completed, I set about unleashing my entire arsenal on Ghandi's nuke-happy head, starting with his capital. A mere turn later, Delhi was mine, and another turn after that, every last city of the Indian empire had been reduced to ash by nuclear fire. I didn't bother conquering the rest. I didn't need to. For turn 500 had come at last, and the highest score was mine to hold.  10/10, would nuke Ghandi again.",1,0

Hope to see much more content but as it exists - it's very half baked. Rushed out to launch with the vive I guess - now it fades into all the other shovel ware.,-1,0

237310,Elsword,"I really enjoy this game. Each character has something special about them, so no character is the same. The playstyle of each character is different, and the multiple character creation helps if you get bored of a certain character. The story isn't the greatest, but the later dungeons are enjoyable and fun to do, especially with friends.  I would like to warn you that if you are new, the game does appear very pay to win. And to all of the people saying you HAVE to pay to actually do good in the game, you're wrong. You don't NEED more inventory space, a pet, a good costume, a good weapon, and etc. As long as you have armor you can do perfectly fine in this game. I'll repeat it again, you don't have to spend a single penny on this game. Just enjoy the game!  One of the few problems with this game is PVP. The community is very, very toxic in PVP. If you join a match you're either going to have someone who is lagging, someone who is hacking, a toxic opponent, a toxic team mate, an AFK, someone who refuses to fight you, someone who is deranking, and so many others.   My final problem with this game is that some characters are unbalanced. You can have a balanced character vs another balanced character in PVP, but then the class change will automatically make a certain character win. It gets really frustrating, honestly. No matter how good you are with a certain character with a certain class, there will always be another class out there to ♥♥♥♥ you over.  Do I recommend this game to new players? Honestly, give it a shot. You can either love it or hate it. If you do play it though, try and get a pal to play it with you. It's a lot more fun to play Elsword with another person.  Thanks for reading my review, and have a nice day!",1,0
12140,Max Payne,"+MAX PAYNE+ Although the game is 15 years old, don't let its age fool you. This game is definitely one of the best action games out there for PC. This game is a 3-in-1 pack because you're reading a comic while watching a noir film while shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the ♥♥♥ wit' yo beretta. This game was definitely ahead of its time. The action in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing sick and the AI is not afraid to kill you. There is alot of replayability because every combat is different, the AI always tries to find ways to put a hole in you and once they do, you die and go back to the begin of the level to find out that this GAME HAS NO AUTOSAVE AND YOU HAVE TO QUICK SAVE CONSTANTLY ♥♥♥♥ING RATS I ALMOST THREW THE KEYBOARD AFTER THIS ♥♥♥♥ING HAPPENED TO ME AND WHEN I QUICK-♥♥♥♥ING-SAVED I COULDNT MOVE SO I THREW THE BURGER KING DRINK NEXT TO ME. Sorry about that, I forgot to mention it... Ooopsssss  Overall this game is really great. Game is old yet gold.  Only con/negative thing about this game though is that, there is no autosave and you have to quicksave the game constantly and when you do, you can't move Max   I know I haven't reached a singl hour on my record, I once played this on a cracked version",1,0

233130,Shadow Warrior,"This Asian styled action FPS reminds me of Pain killer or Serious Sam, except it is much more boring. You play Chinese dude Lo Wang wielding Japanese katana - imho the best weapon in the game. I give credit to authors that the kanji characters are real and used in meaningful way.  First few levels it is quite fun to decapitate enemies. However half through the game you will realize that every level is same. Witty remarks of your character can not change that. It is so repetitive. Weapons suck. The weapons I found most useful against hordes of enemies were crossbow (against big demons) and katana (against most of lesser demons). Against bosses the machine gun or pistol combined with rocket launcher or crossbow is the best. What I was lacking in the game was a serious firepower. Most of time (on hard difficulty) it felt like weapons do a very negligible damage to anything slightly stronger than lesser demon. Before the final level the game literally throws several waves of all enemies in the game mixed together. There are three bosses and with slight differences they are all the same. Same mechanics to kill them. I don't feel like playing this game again. I think for this kind of FPS there are much better options so I won't recommend this.",-1,0

But, if you get this on super-sale, it is a great little ambient game with no 'real' objective but to emotionally engage with the world you wander are able to explore. The 'story' that unravels is interesting, but don't expect to entering an interactive Ulysses or A Moveable Feast as you will be sorely mistaken. I look at this 'game' as more akin to meditation than anything else.",1,0

244630,NEOTOKYO°,"The obvious comparison of this game is to Counterstrike (and it's various derivatives), due to the round structuring, and other near-future shooters like Blacklight:Retribution. There are undeniably some similarities, but let me highlight some of the major features built into NEOTOKYO's design.  1. Class dynamic - class differences are subtle but significant enough to matter. Supports can sponge enough extra bullets and will often prevail in brute force firefights, but this trades off against a lack of mobility. Conversely, Recons have the speed to gain initiative but must rely on that to set up favourable encounters. On the strategic level, differing class access to weapons means that rounds see an evolution in applicable tactics as teams unlock higher tier weapons. The class system also caters to different playstyles as well.  2. Pacing and Ghost Control - Different class speeds mean that map chokepoints are reached at different times (whereas in games where all players have fixed speeds, initial encounters have a definable range). In addition, the semi-random nature of ghost spawns make each match dynamic, with some matches featuring a more natural attacking or defending team.  3. Map Design - the art direction and map design is much more interesting. Maps are labryinthe and multi-leveled, and generally require a team approach; it's often very difficult for an individual to find a spot immune to flanking  4. Lack of respawns - I may be in the minority here, but I think this actually helps out new players. A strong, dominating player can be taken out by a lucky shot or by being swarmed and will be a non-factor in the rest of the match. This sort of scenario isn't possible in a respawn environment, where weak players are ultimately a drag on the team.   While a lot of tactical shooter skills may transfer over, these are the elements that NEOTOKYO features and it will likely provoke a love-it or hate-it reaction. The pacing and map design overall have a lot of subtlety and there's just something very Zen or even wabi-sabi about the minimalistic game design that just makes it feel right given the cyberpunk Japan setting. It's undeniably rough around the edges, but it's generally a really unique experience as FPS games go.",1,0

I hope kids will give it a shot.",1,0

If you decide to pay for features the Nexon company limits your purchase to $60 monthly, through steam. DOES NOT provide portal access to pre-paid services through steam. Trying to get portal access from support you have to wait 1-2 weeks of back and forth e-mail to identify you account, then additional they ask you for Government Identification! Secondarily, NEXON will not provide support to the game without you submitting copies of Government documentation.   Acceptable forms of identification include: Government/State issued photo ID, such as: ,Driver License, Passport, Government Employee ID, Certificate of Birth/Adoption (only if under age 18).  Been gaming over 20 years, NEVER been asked for real life Government documents records to get gaming support from a product I have brought. This should be seriously looked at by steam!",-1,1
